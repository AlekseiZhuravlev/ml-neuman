# find closest point on mesh
# which distance is correct? maybe implementation of _PointFaceDistanceCustom is different.
# We choose _point_to_tri_distance_batched
# todo: get barycentric coordinates of closest point in closest face
# todo: get uv coords of closest face
# todo: get uv coords of closest point on mesh - barycentric interpolation
# todo: check if pts are inside mesh, multiply dist by -1 if not
